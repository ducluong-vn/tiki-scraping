### To track the lowest prices of all books on Tiki

I love reading books but their prices are quite high for a college student like me, fortunately books are sold at a very low price on Tiki (an ecommerce website) with the discount rate can go up to 45%, but every book sales on tiki has a different discount rate, so i decided to write a python script to scrape all book data on tiki and save the lowest of them to lowest_price_tracking.pkl.

The jupyter notebook just displays all books from my favorite publishers with the discount rate above a specific number.
